## Overview

### The challenge

This project was created to develop and improve my skills in JavaScript Events.
The task was to create a slider with an image gallery using Javascript and Events (including Customs Events).

### Links

### How it works

The images are randomly grouped into two groups each time the page is reloaded.
After clicking on the selected image in gallery, a slide show is displayed, below the main image(selected) a collection of images from the same group is created.
The user can switch between the next / previous photo by clicking the selected arrow.
Hovering the mouse over the selected arrow stops the slideshow, moving beyond the arrow resumes the slideshow.
Clicking on the area around the main image closes the slideshow and returns to the gallery.

## My Process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Working on this project allowed me to gain knowledge about events, object events and propagation. I've also learned to create my own events.
In the project, I also used the knowledge from previous projects, which allowed me to consolidate it even more
